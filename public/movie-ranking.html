<h3>The Idea of You</h3>
<p>I read the book version of this movie first and thought the book was AMAZING! I think for a book turned movie, this movie was excellent. Anne Hathaway was excellent in this movie and the music was reall good. Definitely worth a watch!</p>
<h3>It Ends With Us</h3>
<p>This movie was based off the book by Colleen Hoover and the movie was exceptional. The book has really tough subject matter and Justin Baldoni exceuted this movie in the most sensitive way. I also really love anything Blake Lively is in and she did amazing in this role. Overall 10/10, worth seeing!</p>
<h3>Damsel</h3>
<p>This movie was really good! I loved how iconic the ending was and think Millie Bobby Brown's acting was phenomenal. I really hope a second movie comes out!</p>
