<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, welcome to my portfolio! My name is Hayley Cara, I am 26 years old, married, and a dog mama. 
  Let me tell you about why I wanted to get into coding. 
</p>

<p>Growing up, I was obsessed with the online virtual game, 'Club Penguin'. As a kid, I would play this game for hours! 
  I remember going to Family Video Store and I got the Cheetah Girls: One World Ninentdo DS game, 
  I would come home and finish the game the same night. Now this isn't the starting point of my interest. 
  Recently, there have been Club Penguin fan-based servers coming alive on the wide-world internet. I started playing one and really
  got back into the game and became addicted yet again. Unfortunately, the server was shut down and I was devastated as I had worked
  so hard on this account and building it up. I started asking my two best friends who have been coding for 10+ years, 'How can I get 
  another Club Penguin server back up and running?' They explained it to me and I was mind-blown. My friend sent me a course to take
  and I am truly fascinated with it. That is the story!

<p>In this portfolio, you will find content that I created during my education as well as content I have free-handed.
  Please take a look and I look forward to discussing further with you!
